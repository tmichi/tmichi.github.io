# Takashi Michikawa Â 

I am a research scientist with Photonics Control Technology Team at RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, [RIKEN](http://riken.jp/)  (The institute of physical and chemical research) .
My research interests lie in the field of geometric modeling (mesh, volume, points) and its applications to digital engineering, anthropology, medical science, civil engineering and so on.
